## Simulations

The simulation files are named after the respective simulation in the Manuscript. For instance, all simulation files relevant to Simulation Study 1 are labelled "Manuscript_Simulation_1_". Simulation files ending with "*_fun.m" are optimized for parallelization on a computer cluster, and must be called with the job ID (simulation repetition) as the argument. 

In order to run the simulation files, the user must create two folders, "logfiles/Part 1" and "logfiles/Part 2", inside the simulation folder.

Each simulation file is accompanied by a plot function. Note that the repository does not contain simulation data due to the size of the data (~15 GB). Thus, it is recommended to execute the respective simulation to obtain the data, and then call the respective plot function. Note that the names of the log files may not correspond to the names of the simulation files. However, this should be fine for running the data. 

## Behavioral Experiment


Note that, due to the identifiability of voice data, we do not provide the raw data. Instead, we provide the full code of the experiment along with anonymized data upon publication.
